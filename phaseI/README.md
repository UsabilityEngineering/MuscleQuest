# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Our main goal is to gamify working out. There have been some apps that have tried doing this but none have really done it well. The idea is you get rewarded for completing work outs by earning experience or specific loot drops. This adds a form of enjoyment into the application that other workout apps do not include. Especially targeting gamers, our app can also be for non-gamers who need a better way to motivate themselves. However, from a “gamer” sense, grinding a game for rewards is a very common past-time, and to be able to include physical exercise into this process, it could potentially help lots of people get in shape.

## Methods

Analysis of our competitors via the Internet was used to be able to figure out their strengths and weaknesses. Heuristic evaluations were used to analyze the user interface of our competitions in what they did good and bad in terms of usability..

## Findings

After the competitive analysis we discovered that almost all workout apps have a paywall, which is something that we knew wouldn’t be present in MuscleQuest. Other than this we also found that workout applications simply aren’t fun. We wanted MuscleQuest to be very different in this sense, as it will motivate users to want to continue working out in order to earn in-game rewards and get themselves in better physical shape.

## Conclusions

From our methods and findings, we discovered that most workout apps have a paywall and lack an engaging and fun user experience. Our app, MuscleQuest, aims to address these issues by providing a gamified experience without a paywall. By rewarding users for completing workouts with in-game rewards and experience points, we hope to motivate users to continue working out and improve their physical fitness. 

## Caveats

While our app is designed to be engaging and motivating for users, individual results may vary. It is important for users to consult with their doctor or a fitness trainer before beginning any new exercise program. Additionally, our app may not appeal to all users and may require further development and refinement based on user feedback.
