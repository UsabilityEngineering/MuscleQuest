# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The main focus of this application is to gamify the process of working out. To achieve this, we have begun developing an app that utilizes a loot system, character customization and even an in-game resource-based store. During this phase we created a wireframe of this application and received cognitive walkthroughs performed on this wireframe. Our findings can be found below.

## Methods

We began this phase by creating a wireframe that showcased the flow of each page of our application. After we created a functioning wireframe, other groups performed cognitive walkthroughs on this wireframe in order to see how well they could navigate our application and then gave us feedback on their experience and whether or not they had any suggestions for the site.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
