# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The main focus of this application is to gamify the process of working out. To achieve this, we have begun developing an app that utilizes a loot system, character customization and even an in-game resource-based store. During this phase we created a wireframe of this application and received cognitive walkthroughs performed on this wireframe. Our findings can be found below.

## Methods

We began this phase by creating a wireframe that showcased the flow of each page of our application. After we created a functioning wireframe, other groups performed cognitive walkthroughs on this wireframe in order to see how well they could navigate our application and then gave us feedback on their experience and whether or not they had any suggestions for the site.

## Findings

* Firstly, we found that users would like the reassurance that their data is saved at all times. This made us think about the use of a save button or a small piece of text that tells users their data was saved every 15 minutes or so.
* The majority of feedback told us that most users think the site needs to resemble a game better, instead of just being a workout site, since that is what we market the app as. 

## Conclusions

Taking in these findings, we learned that the application needed to closer resemble a game. In order to achieve this, there has been the implementation of a loot system and character customization, giving players something to grind for and continue working out. This would make the app feel much more like a game since it gives constant incentive to play. In conclusion, we believe that these implementations would better fit the user's needs of having a gamified workout app.

## Caveats

* The only limitation was that the wireframe didn't have the ability to convey the feeling of a game all too well since through the cognitive walkthrough, users weren't able to access the loot system, earn resources, or view the store. This could be a reason as to why users thought the app appeared to not resemble a game very well.
