# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive Analysis of leading competitors found a few opportunities for improvement:
       * Priceline: Lots of people who are slightly interested in beginning to workout are barred behind a massive paywall from all competitors.
       * Enjoyment: Workout applications always help guide the user through exercises but aside from that they lack the motivation to help people want to workout.
* Heuristic Evaluation found that the functionality of competitorâ€™s applications are all relatively similar with strongly differing designs and user interface.
* Personas and Scenarios created to reflect the wants and needs of users:
       * Completely free for all users in order to allow anyone to use.
       * Experience and loot earning system to motivate users to continue playing/working out.
       * Rotating challenges every day to liven up users' everyday workouts.
* Sketches and Wireframe illustrate early concepts and builds of the UI.
       * Character customization visible from home screen.
       * All sub-menus accessible from the home screen.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**
* Wireframes: We worked through the flow of our site (so far) and implemented a skeleton for what the site will eventually look like, leaving out certain functionalities.
* Cognitive Walkthroughs: We performed multiple cognitive walkthroughs on the wireframes that our peers created. As well as this, we also received feedback from the walkthroughs that were performed on our wireframe.
* After reviewing these results we decided that the application needs to closely resemble a game inorder to keep those users who are attracted by the game aspect. As well as this, we need to implement save buttons in certain sections of the site to ensure users that their data/progress is secure.
