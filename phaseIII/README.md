# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Our main goal is to gamify working out. There have been some apps that have tried doing this but none have really done it well. The idea is you get rewarded for completing work outs by earning experience or specific loot drops. This adds a form of enjoyment into the application that other workout apps do not include. Especially targeting gamers, our app can also be for non-gamers who need a better way to motivate themselves. However, from a “gamer” sense, grinding a game for rewards is a very common past-time, and to be able to include physical exercise into this process, it could potentially help lots of people get in shape.

## Methods

We began preparing for our user test by preparing a prototype of MuscleQuest where we could observe users interactions with it. The prototype of our app was essentially what our app looks like, but more barebones and easy to understand. Our approach to the user test was to see if our app served the function of being a workout app while also seeing if we "gamified" it enough. For our test, we had five participants come in to use the prototype of the app. We then asked them for their consent for the test and let them know that this test would be private and not released to the public. After doing this, we asked them to do a few tasks on the prototype. The first task is determining if they are able to navigate to a workout that involves legs. The 2nd task is to see if they are able to start a workout on their own.

## Findings

* We found that the majority of users thought our wireframe needed a bit more to its workflow, meaning that we didn’t include enough pages.
* Through the pilot test, we found that users would’ve liked more questions to be related to the gaming aspect of the application. 
* We learned that the workout selection was decent and had enough but it would’ve been better if it was categorized by muscle groups or at least some categorization.

## Conclusions

  In conclusion, we learned that we definitely need to apply more work to the prototype, as ours was far too similar to a wireframe. Along with this, it would have been more adequate if we added some more interaction to the prototype, allowing users to click around to more pages. Some interaction when the user tries to click and start workouts could have been useful as well. To sum up the prototype, it just needed more work. <br />
  After the pilot test, we realized that we didn’t touch on the gaming aspect enough. This led to us having zero information on what users thought about the largest part of the application. I think design-wise we should have also emphasized the point of the application being gamified and centered around earning progress and rewards, as this would have allowed us to have questions in the pilot test asking about the gaming aspect.


## Caveats

Considering the questions we asked during the test, we didn't really ask enough questions that were related to the gaming aspects of the apps. It was more so for the workout aspects. While users did appreciate the workout selections and aspects of the app, they wished they would have experienced the gaming aspects. In other words, we wished we had asked questions that were related to the whole point of our app.
