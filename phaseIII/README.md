# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Our main goal is to gamify working out. There have been some apps that have tried doing this but none have really done it well. The idea is you get rewarded for completing work outs by earning experience or specific loot drops. This adds a form of enjoyment into the application that other workout apps do not include. Especially targeting gamers, our app can also be for non-gamers who need a better way to motivate themselves. However, from a “gamer” sense, grinding a game for rewards is a very common past-time, and to be able to include physical exercise into this process, it could potentially help lots of people get in shape.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

We began this phase by preparing for the pilot test for our product. This test being that it would help us improve the user expereince of our product and see what users would like to see form the app. What we did first was prepare a prototype of MuscleQuest where we can users interations with it. The prototype of our app was essentially what our app looks like but more barebones. 

We began preparing for our user test by preparing a prototype of MuscleQuest where we can users interations with it. The prototype of our app was essentially what our app looks like but more barebones and easy to understand the apps functions. Our approach to th user test was testing to see if our app served the fucntion of being a workout app while also seeing if we "gamified" it enough. 

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
